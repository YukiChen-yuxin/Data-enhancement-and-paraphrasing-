## Introduction
The project expounds the Chinese text retelling method based on multi-level semantic units, retells the text based on two levels of words and sentences, uses seq2 seq based on attention mechanism, obtains the semantic representation of the whole sentence by weighting all hidden layers in the coding part and using multiple semantic information（hidden layer state）.
